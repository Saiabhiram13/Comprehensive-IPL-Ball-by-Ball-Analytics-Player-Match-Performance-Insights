# 🏏 IPL Ball-by-Ball Analytics

## 📌 Project Overview
This project performs a comprehensive exploratory data analysis (EDA) on Indian Premier League (IPL) match-level and ball-by-ball delivery data. The analysis focuses on understanding player batting performance, boundary patterns (fours and sixes), strike rates, and team scoring trends across matches and seasons.

The project involves extensive data cleaning, dataset merging, and query-driven analysis using Python and Pandas on a large dataset containing over 200,000 delivery-level records.

## 🧹 Data Cleaning & Preparation
Key data cleaning steps performed:
- Handling missing and inconsistent values
- Standardizing team and player names
- Filtering irrelevant deliveries (wides, no-balls where required)
- Merging match-level and delivery-level datasets
- Creating derived features such as strike rate and boundary counts
